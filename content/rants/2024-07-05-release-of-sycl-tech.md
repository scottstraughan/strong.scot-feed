Over the past few months, I've been building something that brings together the SYCL ecosystem in a
fresh, accessible way: **[sycl.tech](https://sycl.tech)** — an open source web app for exploring,
learning, and engaging with SYCL!

Built in **Angular** with **TypeScript**, the project aims to be more than just a landing page —
it’s a living, responsive, and developer-friendly platform.

## Features at a Glance

**sycl.tech** offers a wide range of tools and content for both beginners and seasoned SYCL
developers:

- 🔍 **Project Explorer** – Browse SYCL-related projects, videos, research papers, and more through
  a slick UI with full **filtering, searching, and tagging** support.
- 💻 **SYCL Playground** – Write, compile, and run SYCL code right in the browser. Inspect **console
  output** and even **view the compiled assembly**.
- 📰 **SYCL News Feed** – Stay up to date with the latest developments across the SYCL ecosystem.
- 📚 **Tutorials Section** – Learn SYCL step-by-step with approachable guides and code examples.
- 🧩 **...And More** – With a growing set of features designed to make SYCL more accessible and
  collaborative.

## Built with Angular — The Tech Behind the Scenes

This project is written using the latest Angular, taking full advantage of:

- ⚡️ Angular **Signals** for reactive data flow
- 🧠 Smart **caching** for fast performance and smooth UX
- 🎨 Fully customizable **theming**
- 📱 **Responsive design** for seamless use on desktop and mobile
- 🏁 A **static site architecture** that feels dynamic

## The Architecture: Static Meets Dynamic

One of the most exciting aspects of this project is its structure:

- The project is split into **two repos**:
    1. [sycl.tech-website](https://github.com/codeplaysoftware/sycl.tech-website) – the Angular front-end
    2. [sycl.tech-content](https://github.com/codeplaysoftware/sycl.tech-content) – the content repo, containing structured data (YAML/JSON/etc.)

When updates are made to the content repo, the front-end **automatically rebuilds** — allowing the
site to behave like a dynamic app **without requiring a backend**. This hybrid approach makes the
site fast, secure, and incredibly easy to scale and maintain.

## Open Source and Open to Contributions

The project is fully open source! If you're passionate about SYCL or want to contribute to a
cleanly architected Angular app, head over to the [GitHub repos](https://github.com/sycl-tech) and
get involved.

Whether you're writing docs, adding projects, or improving the playground — every contribution
helps.
