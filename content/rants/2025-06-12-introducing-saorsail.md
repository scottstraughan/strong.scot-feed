We’re excited to announce the launch of Saorsail.com — a modern, fast, and privacy-respecting web
app that lets you browse, search, and install Android apps directly from the trusted F-Droid
database.

Whether you’re looking for open-source alternatives to mainstream apps or simply want an easy,
clean interface to manage installs to your device, Saorsail has been built with you in mind.

## 🌟 What is Saorsail?

Saorsail is a fully customizable web app that puts the entire F-Droid ecosystem at your fingertips.
It offers a smooth and responsive interface for discovering Android apps, all without tracking or
ads.

With Saorsail, you can:

- 🔍 Search and filter through the full F-Droid catalog
- ⚡ Install or download apps directly to your Android device
- 🔄 Enjoy real-time updates with modern signals and caching
- 🧩 Tailor the UI to your preferences thanks to its modular and customizable design

It’s powered by Angular and built with performance, usability, and openness at its core.

## 📲 Why Saorsail?

We believe in software freedom and better user control. Existing solutions for browsing F-Droid
apps often feel outdated or clunky — so we built Saorsail to be something better: a fast, modern
interface that respects users and makes discovering quality open-source Android apps effortless.

## 🔧 Under the Hood

Saorsail is written in TypeScript using Angular, and uses cutting-edge features like signals and
local caching to deliver an experience that feels snappy and native. You can install it as a PWA (
Progressive Web App) for even faster access on mobile.

## 🛠 Try it now

Visit saorsail.com to try it out — no account required, and nothing to install.

We hope you enjoy using it as much as we enjoyed building it. If you have feedback, ideas, or
feature requests, we’d love to hear from you.

Welcome to a better way to discover Android apps. Welcome to Saorsail.
