There was a time in my life when World of Warcraft was more than just a game—it was a world I lived
in. A world I escaped to after long days, where friends waited, adventures unfolded, and everything
made a strange kind of sense. Over the years, life pulled me in different directions—as it tends to
do—and slowly, those logins became less frequent. The raids ended, the guild chat grew quiet, and
the friends I made along the way slowly drifted into memory, like phantoms in the Barrens dust.

Even now, years later, the very mention of WoW brings a flood of emotion. It’s nostalgia, yes—but
it’s more than that. It’s remembering who I was back then, what I was going through, and how that
world held space for me when I needed it most. It’s missing the nights in Stormwind or Orgrimmar,
the rush of downing a boss with people who felt like family, and the silly, spontaneous moments
that made the game so human.

To channel those feelings, I started creating World of Warcraft wallpapers—pieces of art that
capture that magic, frozen in time. Each one is a tribute to the places, characters, and emotions
that shaped my experience. Some are bold and epic, others quiet and melancholic. But all of them
come from the same place: a deep love for a world that meant everything to me once.

These wallpapers are my way of reconnecting—with the game, with my memories, and maybe even with a
few people out there who feel the same sense of loss and love for the golden days of Azeroth. I’m
sharing them not just as art, but as pieces of a shared past—free for anyone who wants to remember
what it felt like to ride into the sunset on a mount you fought hard to earn, surrounded by friends
you didn’t know you’d miss so much.

Here’s to the old days. To the ones we lost along the way. And to the world that still waits,
pixel-perfect and timeless, just beyond the login screen.
