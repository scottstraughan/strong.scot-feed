This summer I spent 10 wonderful days in Croatia, and it turned out to be the perfect escape.

The trip started in Dubrovnik, and from the moment I arrived I felt like I was stepping into
another world. The sea was so clear and inviting that I found myself spending hours just walking
along the coast or sitting by the water, letting the sound of the waves slow everything down.

One of my favorite days was the boat trip out to Lokrum Island. The short ride itself was
beautiful — watching Dubrovnik shrink into the distance while the old city walls stood tall behind
us. Lokrum felt almost magical, with its lush greenery, quiet paths, and little spots where you can
slip into the water for a swim.

Food was another highlight. Every meal felt like a treat, whether it was fresh seafood by the
harbor or something simple enjoyed after a long day of exploring. I kept noticing how the flavors
felt so connected to the sea and the season.

I stayed at the Hotel Croatia, and honestly, it was fantastic. Waking up to those views, having
breakfast with the sea right in front of me, and then ending the day with a quiet drink on the
terrace — it all felt like such a luxury.

The only thing I couldn’t help but notice is that Croatia is getting a little more expensive each
year. Still, for me, it was worth every bit. The combination of relaxation, little adventures, and
pure beauty made it one of the most memorable trips I’ve taken.

When I left, I felt rested, happy, and already a little nostalgic. Croatia has a way of getting
under your skin, and I know I’ll be back.
