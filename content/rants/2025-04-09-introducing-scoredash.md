I'm excited to announce the release of **[ScoreDash](https://www.scoredash.xyz)** —
a powerful new tool that helps individuals and organizations assess how well they're following open
source best practices.

Whether you're maintaining a single repository or overseeing dozens across GitHub or GitLab,
ScoreDash provides a clear, actionable overview of where you stand — and how you can improve.

## 🧠 What Is ScoreDash?

ScoreDash is a lightweight, user-friendly tool designed to evaluate your public repositories
against a checklist of open source best practices. From documentation quality to license compliance
and contribution guidelines, ScoreDash generates a comprehensive **adherence score** and offers *
*tailored suggestions** for improvement.

Key features include:

- ✅ **GitHub and GitLab support**
- 🌗 **Dark theme** for low-light environments
- 🚀 **Fast performance** via smart caching
- 🔍 **Searchable dashboards** to quickly find projects or users
- 📈 **Score overviews** with improvement tips
- 📱 **Progressive Web App (PWA)** support — install it like a native app

## ⚙️ How It Works

Just enter a GitHub or GitLab username or organization, and ScoreDash will:

1. Scan all public repositories associated with the account
2. Evaluate each repo using a set of open source best practice metrics
3. Generate a **score summary** and highlight areas for improvement
4. Present everything in a clean, searchable, responsive dashboard

You can also revisit your results later — ScoreDash uses **caching** to speed up repeated lookups
without sacrificing freshness.

## 🔍 Why ScoreDash?

Open source success isn't just about writing code — it's also about fostering collaboration,
encouraging contributions, and maintaining a healthy, transparent development environment.
ScoreDash was created to make those best practices measurable and accessible for everyone.

Whether you're an individual developer, an open source maintainer, or part of a larger dev team,
ScoreDash can help you:

- Quickly audit your public repositories
- Improve visibility into project health
- Benchmark your open source presence over time
