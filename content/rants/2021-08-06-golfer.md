Last weekend, Rebecca and I ventured up to Crieff/Perthshire for a stroll around visit Crieff 
Hydro Hotel.

While there, we hit up the driving range at **Crieff Hydro**, and to everyone's surprise 
(including my own), I actually managed to hit a golf ball without whiffing, tripping, or launching 
my club into the stratosphere. The sun was shining, the grass was green, and my form was... 
well, enthusiastic.

Here‚Äôs actual proof that I did, in fact, hit the ball:

**Highlights of the day included:**

- Successfully connecting with a golf ball (once, but it counts).
- Rebecca not needing first aid after standing nearby.
- Sunburn on only half my face (a classic Scottish tan).

Would I go again? Absolutely. Am I now a golf pro? Only if the bar is extremely low.

Until next time, may your swings be straight and your snacks be plentiful.

*Fore!*
