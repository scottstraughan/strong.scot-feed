There’s something about the Scottish Highlands that feels ancient, untamed, and quietly
powerful—and last weekend, my partner and I finally got to experience it for ourselves. With the
weather unusually kind (yes, actual sunshine!), we set off on a journey that took us through some
of the most breathtaking and soul-stirring landscapes we’ve ever encountered.

Our adventure began on the Isle of Skye, where we hiked up to the Old Man of Storr. Towering stone
pinnacles rising from the hillside, surrounded by vast, rolling moorland—it felt like stepping into
another world. The sky was clear, the breeze gentle, and every few steps offered a new angle on the
incredible view below. It’s hard to describe the feeling of standing there, dwarfed by rock and
sky, but it’s something I won’t forget.

From there, we made our way back to the mainland to visit the iconic Eilean Donan Castle. Nestled
at the meeting point of three sea lochs and connected to the land by a narrow stone bridge, it’s
exactly as dramatic and romantic as you’d imagine. We wandered through the castle’s stone halls,
took far too many photos from every possible angle, and just stood for a while watching the light
dance on the water.

But one of the most unexpectedly beautiful parts of the trip was Glenelg Beach. Tucked away from
the more well-trodden routes, it felt like our own private corner of the Highlands. Soft sand,
clear waters, and that wide open sky—it was peaceful in a way that’s hard to come by. We sat for a
while listening to the gentle waves, completely surrounded by raw, wild beauty.

Everywhere we went, the Highlands gave us space to breathe, to reflect, and to just be. The good
weather was the cherry on top, letting us see the landscape in all its vivid glory. We left feeling
recharged, a little sun-kissed, and already plotting our return.
