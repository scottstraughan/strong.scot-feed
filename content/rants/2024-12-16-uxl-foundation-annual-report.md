[View the UXL Foundation 2024 Report](https://oneapi.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/UXL-Foundation-Annual-Report-2024.pdf)

As part of my work at Codeplay Software, I had the awesome opportunity to take the reins on the
design of the 2024 UXL Foundation Annual Report — and I’m really proud of how it turned out!

I was responsible for the full creative direction, including:

- 🎨 **Graphics**
- 📐 **Layout**
- 🖌️ **Styling**

Every detail — from colour choices to page flow — was carefully crafted to reflect the bold,
forward-looking identity of the UXL Foundation. I made sure the design stayed true to their
established brand, using the full palette and vibe that makes UXL so distinctive.

The end result? A sleek, vibrant, and fully polished PDF report, professionally formatted and
distributed widely across digital channels.

### A Few Highlights:

- Integrated brand colours and typography throughout
- Designed custom infographics and visual storytelling elements
- Optimised for both screen viewing and printable layout

Creating this report was a rewarding blend of creative design and strategic storytelling — and
being able to do it as part of my role at Codeplay made it even more meaningful.

Stay tuned — I might just start designing coffee table books next. 😉
